                Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Benjamin Pham. I am an Associate-Level Actuary. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                Having worked in the insurance industry of 3 years, I had rediscovered my passion for creation, design and programming.
                <br></br><br></br>
                After taking a career break, I had completed CS50's online computer science program and now undertaking a Masters in IT at UNSW (and loving it!)
                <br></br><br></br>
                This website will be used to highlight my journey and work as I pursue career path. Thanks for tagging along!
